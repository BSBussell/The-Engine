## Purpose
To be a fun and powerful Game Engine. Made completly open source and community based. 

## How to Use
You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) to clone and build the engine. On OSX you'll need the XCode command line tools:
```

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/BSBussell/The-Engine

```
On OSX simply open up the XCode project and Compile it<br>
Its probably a bit different on Windows but I'll cross that bridge when I get there.
